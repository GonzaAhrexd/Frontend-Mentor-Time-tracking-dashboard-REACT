## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) 
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I could practice React.js and I learned the use of Styled components and reviewed CSS Grid, I use JavaScript function array.map to easily set the 6 categories using just one component.

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on learning React.js, I  think that's amazing!
